- **Vocabulary**: 50,000 tokens from 200 documents

## 🧠 Key Components Explained

### 1. 🔄 Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)

**What it is**: A memory-efficient attention mechanism where we have fewer Key-Value heads than Query heads.

**Why it matters**:
- **Memory Savings**: 50-75% reduction in attention memory
- **Performance**: Nearly identical to full attention
- **Scalability**: Essential for large models

**How it works**:
```python
# Traditional: 8 Q heads + 8 K heads + 8 V heads = 24 heads
# GQA: 8 Q heads + 2 K heads + 2 V heads = 12 heads
# Each KV head is "shared" across multiple Query heads
```

**Implementation**: The `repeat_kv()` function repeats each KV head to match the number of Query heads.

### 2. 📐 RMSNorm (Root Mean Square Normalization)

**What it is**: A modern alternative to LayerNorm that's more efficient and stable.

**Mathematical Formula**:
```
RMSNorm(x) = x / sqrt(mean(x²) + ε) * g
```

**Why it's better**:
- **Simpler**: No centering (no mean subtraction)
- **More Efficient**: Fewer operations than LayerNorm
- **Better Stability**: Improved numerical stability
- **Modern Standard**: Used in LLaMA, Qwen, and other SOTA models

**Comparison**:
- **LayerNorm**: `(x - mean(x)) / std(x) * g + b`
- **RMSNorm**: `x / sqrt(mean(x²)) * g`

### 3. 🔥 SwiGLU Activation Function

**What it is**: A modern activation that combines Swish and GLU (Gated Linear Unit).

**Mathematical Formula**:
```
SwiGLU(x) = Swish(W1(x)) ⊙ W2(x)
Where:
- W1(x) is the "gate" (controls information flow)
- W2(x) is the "value" (actual transformation)
- ⊙ is element-wise multiplication
- Swish(x) = x * sigmoid(x)
```

**Why it's superior**:
- **More Expressive**: Can represent more complex functions than ReLU
- **Smooth Gradients**: Better for training than ReLU
- **Gating Mechanism**: Selective information flow
- **SOTA Performance**: Used in PaLM, LLaMA, Qwen

### 4. 🔄 Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)

**What it is**: A modern way to encode position information by rotating vectors instead of adding position embeddings.

**Key Innovation**:
- **Rotation-based**: Encodes position by rotating query and key vectors
- **Relative Position**: Naturally handles relative positions
- **Extrapolation**: Can handle sequences longer than training
- **No Parameters**: More efficient than learned embeddings

**How it works**:
1. Split embedding into pairs: `[x1, x2, x3, x4] → [[x1,x2], [x3,x4]]`
2. Rotate each pair by angle `θ_i = i / (10000^(2j/d))`
3. Creates a spiral pattern in high-dimensional space

### 5. 🚀 Muon Optimizer

**What it is**: A revolutionary optimizer that combines momentum with Newton-Schulz orthogonalization.

**Key Components**:
1. **Momentum**: Remembers past gradients (like Adam)
2. **Orthogonalization**: Makes gradients "well-behaved" using Newton-Schulz
3. **Adaptive Learning Rates**: Adjusts based on matrix dimensions

**Why it's special**:
- **30-50% Faster Convergence**: Than Adam
- **More Stable Training**: Fewer gradient explosions
- **Better Generalization**: Works well on new data
- **Transformer Optimized**: Particularly good for transformer models

**Mathematical Core**:
The Newton-Schulz iteration finds the "square root" of the identity matrix, effectively finding the "best rotation" for gradients.

### 6. 🏗️ Pre-norm Architecture

**What it is**: Applying normalization before each sub-layer instead of after.

**Structure**:
```
x → RMSNorm → Attention → x + attention(x)
x → RMSNorm → FeedForward → x + feedforward(x)
```

**Why it's better**:
- **Stable Gradients**: Prevents vanishing gradients in deep networks
- **Modern Standard**: Used in most recent transformer models
- **Training Stability**: More stable than post-norm

### 7. 🔗 Weight Tying

**What it is**: Sharing weights between input embeddings and output layer.

**Implementation**:
```python
self.lm_head.weight = self.token_embedding.weight
```

**Benefits**:
- **Parameter Reduction**: Fewer parameters to train
- **Better Generalization**: Shared representations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Less memory usage

## 🛠️ Training Pipeline

### Data Processing
1. **Streaming**: Load large datasets without memory issues
2. **Caching**: Avoid reprocessing the same data
3. **Tokenization**: Convert text to numbers using BPE tokenizer
4. **Sliding Windows**: Create training examples for next-token prediction

### Training Features
1. **Gradient Accumulation**: Simulate larger batch sizes
2. **Mixed Precision**: Faster training with minimal accuracy loss
3. **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Warmup + cosine decay
4. **Gradient Clipping**: Prevent gradient explosions
5. **Model Checkpointing**: Save best model during training

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Loss**: Cross-entropy loss (lower is better)
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct next-token predictions
- **Perplexity**: exp(loss) - measures model's "surprise"
